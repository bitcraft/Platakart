Getting Set Up To Work
======================

The preferred way to work with Platakart and its dependencies is with
virtualenv via virtualenvwrapper however this is not stictly
necessary. Instructions are provided for setting a system up for working on
Platakart with and without virtualenv.

The instructions favor working with Linux. virtualenv and virtualenvwrapper can
be configured to work from a windows machine but not quite as easily as from a
Linux machine.

Prerequisites
=============
* A git client to checkout the source and some of the dependencies
* A mercurial client for getting the source for pygame and pymunk
* Python 2.7.x
* [Tiled map editor](mapeditor.org)
* Be familiar with [environment variables](http://docs.python.org/2/using/cmdline.html#environment-variable)
* Your favorite text editor
* Maybe a beer or two.

virtualenv with virtualenvwrapper
=================================

First install python2.7.5+ if you don't already have it installed.

See [virtualenvwrapper](http://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html) for setup instructions for virtualenv wrapper.

Create a virtual environment for Platakart that uses cPython 2.7 and that does not inherit system packages:
    
    mkvirtualenv -p /usr/bin/python2.7 --no-site-packages

Create a directory for working with Platakart and its dependencies:

    mkdir ~/Projects
    
It is possible to satisfy all of the dependencies without getting the source, but having the source on hand can make working on Platakart a lot easier. 

Checkout the dependencies:

    hg clone https://bitbucket.com/pygame/pygame
    hg clone https://bitbucket.com/viblo/pymunk
    git clone https://github.com/bitcraft/pytmx
    git clone https://github.com/bitcraft/pyscroll
    git clone https://github.com/wkmanire/pymunktmx
    git clone https://github.com/wkmanire/PlataKart

_*You could batch all of these together in one command but the author finds it best to run them one at a time._

Now let's build and install pygame into our virtualenv. First you'll need to make sure you have all of the required packages installed to build it.

With aptitude on Debian-based systems:

	sudo apt-get install build-essential \
		python-dev python-numpy \
		ffmpeg libsdl-image1.2-dev \
		libsdl-mixer1.2-dev libsdl-ttf2.0-dev \
		libsmpeg-dev libsdl1.2-dev \
		libportmidi-dev libswscale-dev \
		libavformat-dev libavcodec-dev

	cd pygame && python setup.py build
	sudo python setup.py install
	
<script>
window.scroll(0, 100000);
setTimeout(function () {
	window.location = window.location;
}, 1000);
</script>
